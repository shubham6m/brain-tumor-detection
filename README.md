**Brain tumor**
==============================

This dataset was exported via <a href="roboflow.com">roboflow website</a> 
you can check more about the project from <a href="https://universe.roboflow.com/brain-tumour-detection-s2oyl/brain-tumor-5na5y">here</a> 

Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time


The dataset includes 118 images.
Brain-tumour are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

No image augmentation techniques were applied.
I'm happy to share my recent deep learning project Brain tumor detection in python, the dataset was exported via Roboflow website. 
Literally I learned a lot from there like how to do testing in ML, even I have some idea about the process in theory subject but not practically, truly I had not a plan to dive into ML or Deep learning projects.ðŸ˜‚ I thought it might be more interesting than local programming language because I personally thinks that in ML & DL there we get result & on hand project which sometime not might take much, if I said truly I just do testing for 118 images only.
May be I'm not perfect on this project but soon I'll do more on ML & do my best at all.
